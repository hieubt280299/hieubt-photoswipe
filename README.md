# HieuBT's PhotoSwipe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my customized PhotoSwipe component library to display media gallery - just like this [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) library.

## Available Scripts

My library is still under development, but you can run this command to test it:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
